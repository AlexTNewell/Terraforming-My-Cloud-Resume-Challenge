# Terraforming-My-Cloud-Resume-Challenge

The Cloud Resume Challenge encompasses a series of carefully designed challenges aimed at cementing one's proficiency in AWS, while enhancing one's ability to implement IaC and CI/CD piplines. The primary objective is to develop and deploy a static website that serves as a professional resume.

Full details can be found here: https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/

While I originally completed the challenge using CloudFormation, I wanted to challenge myself and also complete it using Terraform. For more information see here: https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/extensions/terraform-getting-started/.
