# Terraforming-My-Cloud-Resume-Challenge

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a series of challenges designed to develop your proficiency in AWS, infrastructure as code and CI/CD.

The primary objective is to develop and deploy a static website that serves as a professional resume.

The original challenge is to use CloudFormation.

However, I wanted to challenge myself and use Terraform.

For my completed version of the original challenge using CloudFormation see:
