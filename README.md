# Terraforming-My-Cloud-Resume-Challenge

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a series of challenges, each of which enhances your AWS knowledge and provides an opportunity to showcase technical experience in using AWS. The main goal is to create and deploy a static website hosting a resume.

Full details can be found here: https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/

While I completed the challenge using CloudFormation, I wanted to challenge myself and also complete it using Terraform instead. For more information see here: https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/extensions/terraform-getting-started/.
